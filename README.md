```
**4. New way to kick-start**
How to kick-start a data science project

Old way ü•¥
- import libraries you'll need
- dealing with import-related errors
- search the correct import statement on Google

(repeat the cycle, depending on the project's complexity)

New way ü§ì
- pip install pyforest

PyForet gives you an unfair advantage to jumpstart any data science projects
With just one line of code, you can import the 40 most commonly used Python libraries
Libraries are loaded on-demand, consuming memory space only when a specific function or method is invoked
This saves you time and ensures that your code doesn't slow down due to unnecessary imports
I can't believe I wasted so much time hunting down imports statements!

**5. Install all Python libraries:**
You must install Python and its libraries. If not, you can install it using:
```
pip install pyforest

```

 **6. Explore the Analysis:** Dive into the analysis by opening the `Babar Azam Data Visualization.ipynb` file in your preferred Python environment.
